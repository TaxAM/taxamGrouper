# Taxam Grouper

- [pt-br](doc/docs/readme-pt_br.md)

TaxAM Grouper is a module of tools of the project [TaxAM](https://github.com/TaxAM/taxam) created to group samples by the matrices generated by TaxAM. In this module, we have the following tools:
- [Grouper](https://github.com/TaxAM/taxam_grouper)    

    Used to group samples by the matrices generated by TaxAM.

- [Taxam Grouper GUI](https://github.com/TaxAM/taxam_grouper/tree/main/groups_viewer)

    Used to visualize the groups generated by TaxAM Grouper.

## Grouper
It uses some algortihms to group samples. The first one is the [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm. The second one is the [Hierarchical Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) algorithm.

### How to use Grouper

1. Install all the dependencies in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run grouper script.

```sh
python grouper <algorithm_name> <flag_1> <value_1> <flag_2> <value_2> ...
```

- Global flags:
    - `-fp` or `--file_path`: Matrix to group.
    - `-on` or `--output_name`: Name for the taxam grouper file. Default "TaxAM_grouper".
    - `-h` or `--help`: Show help message and exit.

- K-means flags:
    - `-n` or `--number_of_clusters`: Set the number of clusters that Kmeans will use to group samples. Default 2.
    - `-ni` or `n_init`: Number of times that k-means algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia. Default 10
    - `-mi` or `max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a single run. Default 300.

#### Use example
```sh
python grouper kmeans -fp "matrix.txt" -on "TaxAM_grouper" -n 3
```

## Taxam Grouper GUI
It is a GUI that allows you to visualize the groups generated by TaxAM Grouper.

- Open the [index.html](groups_viewer/index.html) file in the folder of the TaxAM Grouper GUI.
- Select the matrix that you want to visualize.

    ![Choose file](doc/src/images/choose_file.png)
- Click on the button "Visualizar".

    ![Visualize](doc/src/images/view_btn.png)
- Then you can see the groups.
